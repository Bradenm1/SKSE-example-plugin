# SKSE Example Plugin
---
This is a fork of the https://github.com/xanderdunn/skaar example plugin. 

I have added a custom function which adds all perks to the player character. In this case I created a .esp which adds a button to riverwoods coc location which calls the custom c++ function through papyrus.

I have editied the SKSE project as to not compile as it was causing me major issues and included compliled .libs. This is the reason for no .gitignore as the compiled files are required. The repo is a little big as a result.

I used VS 2017 in this project.
